# Password Generator

This app creates a complex password.  
It saves the password to the clipboard and shows the password in a message box.  
The password is broken up into four character blocks, sepearted by a hyphen.  
This was an initial version of the password gen application. 

It is now deprecated in favour of the Rust version, which has several bug fixes.
